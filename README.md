# Simple React Weather App

A weather application build on React and the Open Weather Map API. It allows you to get the current temperature for any location.

## Getting Started

You will have to create an account and get an API key from ![OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). Then, create a file with the key, export it and import it within the Weather component.

e.g: "import openWeatherMapKey from '../weather_api_key/openWeatherMapKey';"
